  Inspire is a Web Page that you can use to get general information like the current time, temperature, daily quotes and a to-do list to make sure that you are up to date on the things you need to do.
   You can add a to-do to your list and when you have finished it you have the ability to mark it off. You can also delete to-do's if you no longer want to use them.
   This project was build using JavaScript and NodeJS. We connected to several API's in order to get the weather, quote and pictures.
